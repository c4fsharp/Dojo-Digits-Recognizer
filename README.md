Dojo "Digits Recognizer"
======================

This Dojo is inspired by the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer contest](http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).
The goal is to write a **Machine Learning** classifier from scratch, a program that will recognize hand-written digits automatically.
It is a guided Dojo, **suitable for beginners**: the Dojo comes with a Script file, with specific tasks to complete, introducing along the way numerous F# concepts and syntax examples.
The Dojo is on the longer side; for a group with limited F# experience, it is recommended to **schedule it for 2 hours and a half**.
